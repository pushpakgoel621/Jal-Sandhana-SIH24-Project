# Groundwater Chatbot - Jal Sandhana

## Overview
Jal Sandhana is an AI-based chatbot designed to provide concise and informative answers related to groundwater. It assists users in understanding groundwater levels, hydrogeological scenarios, water quality, groundwater resource assessment, and NOC (No Objection Certificate) requirements for groundwater extraction in India.

## Features
- Extracts relevant data from PDFs and stores it in a FAISS-based vector database.
- Uses Hugging Face embeddings to improve search and retrieval accuracy.
- Integrates with Groq's API to generate AI-driven responses.
- Implements a FastAPI-based backend with CORS support for secure API access.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- **Embeddings**: Hugging Face's `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **LLM API**: Groq with LLaMA 3 Model
- **Document Processing**: PyPDFLoader
- **Environment Management**: dotenv
